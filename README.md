# Two-Strings-ALGO.This implementation checks if two strings share any common characters by storing characters from the first string in a HashSet and checking if any character from the second string exists in the set, returning "YES" if they share at least one common character and "NO" otherwise, efficiently solving the problem in O(n + m) time complexity.
